## Workflow statuses

See [workflow statuses](statuses.md) for an at-a-glance overview of CI across the organization. The table is updated automatically by the [Aggregate Workflow Statuses](.github/workflows/aggregate-statuses.yml) workflow (hourly and on demand). For triggers and optional `GH_TOKEN` (PAT for private repos), see [Aggregate statuses](docs/aggregate-statuses.md).

For manual badge setup in READMEs, see [Static badges](docs/static-badges.md).
